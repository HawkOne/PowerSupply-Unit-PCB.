# PowerSupply-Unit-PCB.
This project's goal is to create board capable of Signal Generation and Smart Cable Management in order to Trasform a ATX-PSU or similar into a Bench Power Supply

Version 1.0 has just a 555 timer and two potentiometers to generate a square wave signal and control its frequency and duty cycle.

Version 2 is in WIP and will have more than that:
  1) The continuous signal generator will have a way to control if the signal wave will be square, triangular, saw, sinusoidal, ecc.
  2) a nice addition that I would love to have is a variable voltage power supply, with its potentiometer and a display,
  3) one or more usb ports to power breadboards and projects,
  4) Switches, lots of switches, aviation styly, I just love them.
  5) Also, I'll increase the resistance on the plug led, as the blue led is too bright.

  6) any suggestion is appreciated!
